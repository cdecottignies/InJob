The architecture of the project is as follow.
The main branch is prod branch,
The dev branch is as it named, the development branch,
And for each feature, we create a feature branch, once the development is done, we merge the feature branch into the dev branch, and delete the feature branch.

> We decided to put the front-end and the back-end in the same repo, because we think it's easier to manage, and we can work on the same project at the same time.
As we need to run the Database, Back and Front at the same time, we need to have all the tree parts accessible in the same branch.

## The link to Doc GitHub repo

The Doc is on another repo, because on the JobBord Epitech repo, the Actions arren't allowed, so we can't deploy the doc.
